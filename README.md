### Introduction
Regardless of the speculative bubbles in Bitcoin price, this project aims to give a hint on the future closing price values of this cryptocurrency. 
Considering several Bitcoin indicators as per my analysis, sentiment data along with blockchain, historical prices and financial indices data are gathered to predict the closing price. 


### Environment Setup
To run the Prediction Models the following should be installed:

1. Python 3+
2. Tensorflow=1.10.1
3. Keras=2.2.2
4. Pandas=0.23.4
5. Numpy=1.15.1
6. Matplotlib=2.2.3
7. sklearn=0.19.2

### Work in Progress
#### Three models that will be implemented are:
1. LSTM
2. GRU
3. XGBoot
